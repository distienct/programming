#name a method in ruby as you would name a variable: Snake Case.



def multiply (a, b)
  a * b
end

puts multiply(4,  5)
puts multiply(14, 15)
puts multiply(6,  8).odd?
puts multiply(2,  7)
puts multiply 9,  4

#most ruby developers prefer to omit the round brackets. however if you're chaining things together, you need to keep them in. (line 7)
